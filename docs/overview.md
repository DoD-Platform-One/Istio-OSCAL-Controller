# OSCAL Istio Compliance Controller

The [OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/) Istio compliance controller performs continuous assessment of
the [NIST SP 800-53 controls](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf) that
can be leveraged with the [Istio](https://istio.io/) service mesh.

The project implements different controls using the [Lula project](https://docs.lula.dev/oscal/).
